### Backprop Evolution [#5](https://github.com/mmajewsk/ml_research/issues/5)

Generally it shows evolving operators of backpropagation. 
Instead of applying backpropagation, they use Genetic Algorithm to find some new operators.
It was trained on Wide Residual Networks, and als(https://github.com/mmajewsk/ml_research/issues/5) they say that in the long run none of the optimisers did not outrun backprop.

### Reproducibility of Benchmarked Deep Reinforcement Learning Tasks for Continuous Control [#7](https://github.com/mmajewsk/ml_research/issues/7)
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04133
Some guys from quebec are trying to reproduce someresults from openai lab and papers, specifically in using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients () and Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). The results show that - suprise, suprise. Some people do not share enough information to reproduce the results.
