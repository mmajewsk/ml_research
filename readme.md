### Backprop Evolution 
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02822.pdf)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02822.pdf]
Generally it shows evolving operators of backpropagation. 
Instead of applying backpropagation, they use Genetic Algorithm to find some new operators.
It was trained on Wide Residual Networks, and also they say that in the long run none of the optimisers did not outrun backprop.
